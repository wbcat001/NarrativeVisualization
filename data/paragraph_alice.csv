0,0,1,CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole,5,31,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,1,"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”",57,302,field,EXT,day,Alice's boredom with reality,"Alice sits by her sister on a bank, feeling tired and uninterested as she peeks into a book with no pictures or conversations.

2,2,1,"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.",55,289,field,EXT,day,Alice sees the White Rabbit,"Alice notices a White Rabbit with pink eyes and a watch, which sparks her curiosity and prompts her to follow it.",7.0,Action,"The White Rabbit runs past Alice, muttering about being late.",White Rabbit,Inciting Incident
3,3,1,"There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",141,739,hole,EXT,day,Alice sees the White Rabbit,"Alice notices a White Rabbit with pink eyes and a watch, which sparks her curiosity and prompts her to follow it.",7.0,Action,The White Rabbit takes a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and hurries on.,White Rabbit,Inciting Incident

6,6,1,"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.",141,715,well,INT,night,Alice's contemplative descent,"As Alice falls down the rabbit hole, she wonders about her surroundings and contemplates various scenarios, revealing her imaginative nature and setting the tone for her experiences to come.",4.0,Action,Alice falls down a rabbit-hole and observes the odd surroundings.,Alice,Setup
7,7,1,"“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)",49,259,well,INT,night,Alice's contemplative descent,"As Alice falls down the rabbit hole, she wonders about her surroundings and contemplates various scenarios, revealing her imaginative nature and setting the tone for her experiences to come.",4.0,,,,Setup
8,8,1,"Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)",131,706,well,INT,night,Alice's contemplative descent,"As Alice falls down the rabbit hole, she wonders about her surroundings and contemplates various scenarios, revealing her imaginative nature and setting the tone for her experiences to come.",4.0,Statement,Alice contemplates the depth of her fall and her knowledge of geography.,Alice,Setup
9,9,1,"Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”",125,684,well,INT,night,Alice's contemplative descent,"As Alice falls down the rabbit hole, she wonders about her surroundings and contemplates various scenarios, revealing her imaginative nature and setting the tone for her experiences to come.",4.0,,,,Setup
10,10,1,"Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",191,980,well,INT,night,Alice lands in a dark hall,"After her fall, Alice finds herself in a dimly lit hall filled with locked doors, which represents her feelings of frustration and entrapment.",6.0,Statement,"Alice thinks of her cat, Dinah, while falling.",Alice,Turning Point
11,11,1,"Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.",120,578,hall,INT,night,Alice lands in a dark hall,"After her fall, Alice finds herself in a dimly lit hall filled with locked doors, which represents her feelings of frustration and entrapment.",6.0,Action,The Rabbit is heard exclaiming about being late while rushing down a passage.,White Rabbit,Turning Point

13,13,1,"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",109,558,table,INT,night,Alice discovers the key,"Alice finds a small golden key on a glass table and begins to hope it can unlock her way out of the hall, representing her first tangible step towards escape and discovery.",5.0,Action,Alice finds a tiny golden key and discovers a small door.,Alice,Inciting Incident
14,14,1,"Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.",135,719,hall,INT,night,Alice finds the small door to the garden,"Using the key, Alice discovers a tiny door leading to a beautiful garden, symbolizing her desire for exploration and freedom as she yearns to enter.",6.0,,,,Turning Point
15,15,1,"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.",82,423,hall,INT,night,Alice drinks from the 'Drink Me' bottle,"Alice finds a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' and decides to taste it despite her initial hesitations, leading to her shrinking in size and enabling her to access the garden.",7.0,Action,Alice finds a bottle labelled 'DRINK ME' and deliberates whether to drink it.,Alice,Climax
16,16,1,"It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.",131,701,hall,INT,night,Alice drinks from the 'Drink Me' bottle,"Alice finds a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' and decides to taste it despite her initial hesitations, leading to her shrinking in size and enabling her to access the garden.",7.0,,,,Climax
17,17,1,"However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",44,261,hall,INT,night,Alice drinks from the 'Drink Me' bottle,"Alice finds a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' and decides to taste it despite her initial hesitations, leading to her shrinking in size and enabling her to access the garden.",7.0,,,,Climax

19,19,1,"And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.",118,600,hall,INT,night,Alice's conflicting emotions about her size,"After drinking, Alice worries about the possibility of shrinking too much or becoming lost in the process, reflecting her uncertainty and growth as she navigates this strange world.",5.0,Statement,Alice expresses excitement about being the right size to go through the little door into a lovely garden.,Alice,Turning Point
20,20,1,"After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.",101,516,hall,INT,night,Alice's struggle to get the key,"Upon deciding to enter the garden, Alice realizes she has forgotten the key and is unable to retrieve it, showcasing her feelings of frustration and entrapment once again.",6.0,Action,Alice realizes she forgot the key after shrinking down to a smaller size.,Alice,Crisis
21,21,1,"“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person!”",112,632,table,INT,night,Alice finds the 'EAT ME' cake,"Desperate to enter the garden, Alice discovers a cake labeled 'EAT ME' and decides to eat it, hoping it will change her size and allow her access.",5.0,Action,Alice tries to give herself advice and scolds herself for crying out of frustration.,Alice,Climax
22,22,1,"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”",82,407,table,INT,night,Alice finds the 'EAT ME' cake,"Desperate to enter the garden, Alice discovers a cake labeled 'EAT ME' and decides to eat it, hoping it will change her size and allow her access.",5.0,Action,Alice finds a cake labelled 'EAT ME' and decides to eat it.,Alice,Climax
23,23,1,"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.",86,446,table,INT,night,Alice's anticlimactic result from the cake,"After eating the cake, Alice is disappointed to find that it does not change her size, leading her to contemplate the unpredictability of her new circumstances.",5.0,,,,Resolution

I’m sure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go!

Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",134,696,castle,INT,day,Alice meets the White Rabbit,"The White Rabbit returns, dressed lavishly, but is startled by Alice when she tries to speak to him, causing him to drop his gloves and fan and flee, intensifying Alice's feelings of loneliness.",6.0,Action,"The White Rabbit rushes past Alice, dropping his gloves and fan in fright.",White Rabbit,Turning Point

I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?
